The Monkees front-end project.
===

This is a front-end project consisting of four pages , index.html, WhoWeAre.html,OurSongs and OurConcerts.
The project is using Bootstrap, responsive design, photographic backgrounds, creating a subject-related environment.
The project is responsive and is using a mobile-first approach.It is easy to use and has a positive effect on
the visitor/user.The backgrounds are carefully chosen and are underlining the band's long experience.Overall,
it is a easy to use , mobile-friendly web page that will lead to a pleasant experience for the desired target audience.

UX.
---

The project is designed for the band's audience and the band's fan base and not only.Every music fan and people who are 
looking for e planned event entertainment they should realize using this web-page that the band is approachable and 
affordable, getting easy in contact with the band using the contact form .The navigation bar is a way to get to the 
home page but the more attractive navigation menu situated center-lower side of the page will take the user to
the next pages that contains photos of the band members,information about the band,  music samples from the rich portofolio 
and a schedule of the concerts from the band next tours.There are also user experience feedbacks from around the social-media
and buttons designed to help the users to contact the band representatives for organising future events.
Please find inside the main project directory inside "sketches folder" , the drawings that helped me to plan the creation of the project.

Deployment
---
I have deployed my project  on Github Pages where i've had some problems with the links, i have asked a tutor for help
to link my external css file as it wasn't recognised .After that, i've had some problems with links addresses in the css file for 
background images, but after a research on internet i was able to fix it.
I have built this project using Notepad++ and continued in c9.
