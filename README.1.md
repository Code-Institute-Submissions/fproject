*Index page*
---

Navbar - contains the brand name that is clickable and takes the user to the home page from any page.

The same thing does the "home" link .I have made the brand name to link to home page because the "home" link 

collapses into the dropdown and it is easier for the user to click the brand name.

The navbar contains also the "about us" link that links any page of "WhoWeAre" page, useful for getting info about the band.

The navbar also contains some social media links. These are also present on any page.
